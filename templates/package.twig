    <h4 class="headline--alpha">Selection Process</h4>
    <p>
        The call for speakers closes {{ site.enddate | date("l, F j, Y") }} at 11:59pm PST (-7 GMT). Once the deadline has 
        passed the speaker committee will begin reviewing applications. All applicants will be 
        notified regarding the status of their talk/talks in the month of June. If you submit 
        multiple talks you will only receive one response.	
    </p>
    <h4 class="headline--alpha">Tips for Submission</h4>
    <p>
       We encourage potential speakers to upload more than one pitch, but no more than two submissions 
       will be accepted from an applicant. If you choose to submit more than two, the first two will 
       be the only pitches considered. Be sure your talk description/abstract defines the exact topic 
       you want to talk about and what you hope people will learn from your session.
    </p>
